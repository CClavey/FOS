Folder/File Organization: 

  The project files are organized by their file extension types. Inside of the "main" folder there is a JS, CSS, and an Images folder containing there     
  respective files while the actual project code and files are placed inside of "main". The JS folder contains one file named "scripts" which contains all 
  of the necessary javascript functions for the project, the CSS folder contains a file named "styles" which contains all the styling of the project, and 
  the Images folder contains the images used for the project. The file organization could be more cohesive for the project, but the project was built 
  without it initially and it would be more of a task to organize the php files into their own folders and then go back and fix all of the routing and  
  errors that may occur from a change like that.
